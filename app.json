For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d.

No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d.

This is a fancy way of saying that the factors that influence how an ultramarathon turns out are numerous and interconnected. A \"high dimensional space\" is a mathematical concept where multiple variables interact simultaneously - imagine trying to plot dozens of points that each have many coordinates, not just x, y, and z. In ultrarunning, these \"dependency variables\" might include:\n\n- Physical factors: training volume, nutrition, hydration, sleep quality\n- Environmental conditions: temperature, humidity, altitude, terrain\n- Mental states: confidence, stress levels, motivation\n- Race-specific elements: pacing strategy, gear choices, crew support\n- Life context: work-life balance, family support, overall stress levels\n\nFixating on just one or two variables (like finish time or placing) creates a narrow, potentially unsatisfying experience. In other words, enjoy the process and the outcome regardless of your time. Time is not a fundamental entity, but rather an emergent property arising from interactions between things, and our perception of time as a linear flow is an illusion created by the complexity of these interactions; essentially, \"time is the story we tell ourselves about the world.\". Time is not a container that things exist within, but rather a measure of how things relate to each other through interactions and changes. Despite its fleeting nature, time is a source of meaning and allows us to experience the richness of life.\n\n\n\n","type":"text"},{"name":"data/wser_course_checkpoints.csv","content":"Checkpoint,Miles,Km,Miles to next,Km to next\nOlympic Valley,0,0,10.3,16.6\nLyon Ridge,10.3,16.6,5.5,8.8\nRed Star Ridge,15.8,25.4,8.6,13.9\nDuncan Canyon,24.4,39.3,5.9,9.5\nRobinson Flat,30.3,48.8,4.1,6.6\nMiller's Defeat,34.4,55.4,3.6,5.8\nDusty Corners,38,61.2,5.3,8.5\nLast Chance,43.3,69.7,4.5,7.2\nDevil's Thumb,47.8,76.9,5.1,8.2\nEl Dorado Creek,52.9,85.1,2.8,4.5\nMichigan Bluff,55.7,89.6,6.3,10.2\nForesthill *,62,99.8,8.7,14\nDardanelles (Cal-1) [Not in this data set],65.7,105.7,5,8.1\nPeachstone (Cal-2) *,70.7,113.8,7.3,11.7\nFord's Bar (Cal-3) [Not in this data set],73,117.4,5,8.1\nRucky Chucky,78,125.5,1.8,2.9\nGreen Gate,79.8,128.4,5.4,8.7\nAuburn Lake Trails,85.2,137.1,5.5,8.9\nQuarry Rd,90.7,146,3.6,5.8\nPointed Rocks,94.3,151.8,4.6,7.4\nRobie Point,98.9,159.2,1.3,2.1\nPlacer High School,100.2,161.3,0,0\n","type":"text"},{"name":"data/wser_cp_table.csv","content":"cp_column,cp_number,cp_miles,cp_kilometers,cp_display_name\nolympic_valley,1,0,0,Olympic Valley (0.0M : 0.0K)\nlyon_ridge,2,10.3,16.6,Lyon Ridge (10.3M : 16.6K)\nred_star_ridge,3,15.8,25.4,Red Star Ridge  (15.8M : 25.4K)\nduncan_canyon,4,24.4,39.3,Duncan Canyon  (24.4M : 39.3K)\nrobinson_flat,5,30.3,48.8,Robinson Flat  (30.3M : 48.8K)\nmillers_defeat,6,34.4,55.4,Miller's Defeat  (34.4M : 55.4K)\ndusty_corners,7,38,61.2,Dusty Corners  (38M : 61.2K)\nlast_chance,8,43.3,69.7,Last Chance  (43.3M : 69.7K)\ndevils_thumb,9,47.8,76.9,Devil's Thumb  (47.8M : 76.9K)\nel_dorado_creek,10,52.9,85.1,El Dorado Creek (52.9M : 85.1K)\nmichigan_bluff,11,55.7,89.6,Michigan Bluff  (55.7M : 89.6K)\nforesthill,12,62,99.8,Foresthill  (62M : 99.8K)\npeachstone_cal_2,13,70.7,113.8,Peachstone (Cal-2)  (70.7M : 113.8K)\nrucky_chucky,14,78,125.5,Rucky Chucky  (78M : 125.5K)\ngreen_gate,15,79.8,128.4,Green Gate  (79.8M : 128.4K)\nauburn_lake_trails,16,85.2,137.1,Auburn Lake Trails  (85.2M : 137.1K)\nquarry_road,17,90.7,146,Quarry Road  (90.7M : 146K)\npointed_rocks,18,94.3,151.8,Pointed Rocks  (94.3M : 151.8K)\nrobie_point,19,98.9,159.2,Robie Point  (98.9M : 159.2K)\nfinish,20,100.2,161.3,Finish (Placer H.S.
